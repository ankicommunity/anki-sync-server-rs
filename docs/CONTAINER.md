# Containers 
pre-built images from docker hub for arm64 and amd64 are available, or you can build it by yourselves.

In this manual we will use `docker` command for containers creation/management but it can seamlessly be replaced with `podman` every time it is used.

The `Dockerfile` at the root of the repository controls the build process.
## Pull images from DockerHub and run in container
1. pull image
```
docker pull ankicommunity/anki-sync-server-rs:latest
```
2. run it in background (you can specify the container name by passing `--name=ankisyncd` or use default name).And,you can pass env vars to following command line to add users,for example,following part of env vars will add an account whose username is `test` and password is `123456`.
```
docker run -d -it --name=ankisyncd -e ANKISYNCD_USERNAME=test -e ANKISYNCD_PASSWORD=123456 -p 27701:27701 -v ./data:/app ankicommunity/anki-sync-server-rs:latest
```
Please do not remove the `-e ANKISYNCD_USERNAME=test -e ANKISYNCD_PASSWORD=123456` part, which could be configured in the next step. Otherwise, the container would fail to start.
3. add user
If env variables are already set, which means the account has been added, there is no need to do this step. If not, bring up the shell of the `ankisyncd` container (or default container name) and run command
```
docker exec -it ankisyncd /bin/bash
ankisyncd user -a username password
exit
```
## Building in container, running on host

1. In the root of the repository run: 
```
docker build -t anki-sync-server-rs/builder:latest .
```
2. Then exfiltrate the binary from the container:
```
docker run --rm --entrypoint cat anki-sync-server-rs/builder:latest /usr/local/bin/ankisyncd > ankisyncd
```
3. Use the `ankisyncd` binary obtained as usual


## Building and running in container

1. Build the container: 
```
docker build -t anki-sync-server-rs/runner:latest .
```
2. Run it in foreground: 
```
docker run -it anki-sync-server-rs/runner:latest
```
