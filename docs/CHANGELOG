how to compile rslib sucessfully
1.put anki-sync-server-rs in dir anki-,in its dep toml ,anki={path="../rslib"}
2.put anki-sync-server-rs in anki- cargo.toml field workspace
put anki entirely into project as an crate and use rslib

get session error on msync uploadChanges? 
pattern match err when to hkey == None 

delete deck cause sanity check err :cards and notes arent 
equal. start sucessfully delete records from db,yet applychanges
restore back
1.maybe server usn is not correct,as applychanges use the usn the 
same as start,py impl dont use the usn on applychanges
2.see cards count on applychanges python impl :equal
3.start dont return server graves,see diff to py impl (py dont too)
4.guess before start ,open collection will read db into
memory and will not afftect local db,so operations 
like delete from db dont work until db execute commit ,finally
works,by add begin trx and commit trx in start

media downloadFiles : Ankidroid client err in opening zip file.
1.media db not update on uploadChanges after delete and check media
on client :db update comfirm
2.try open zip data on server to be synced to client,can open
meta data on server
3.compression format not correct? seems have no effect Stored 
and Deflated
4.able to read data from zip on server? ok 
5.response type err ,currently use json(Option<vec<u8>>),
change to body(vec<u8>),err msg changed
6.meta file format incorrect from vec<[String;2]> to 
{files: Vec<(String,Option<String>)>},new err appear
7.no value for 0 ,seems Ankidroid need downloadFiles response
zip meta to be hashmap-like,sucessfully sync

err decode response body EOF when parsing... on Windows
seems applychunks err?
1.change response body to "null",ok

mediaChanges:error decoding response body:
 invalid type: string "1", expected i32
1.change media db entry from Vec<[String;3]> to  Vec<(String,i32,String)>

delete deck then sync on pc fail on applygraves,decoding response
body err
1.response body from "" to "null"

remove unused imports

introduce ankisyncctl(account manager)

create and edit readme

generate Settings.toml when first run executable file

create release file tar.gz,zip,exe,aarch64 executable,publish
to termux 

msync/uploadChanges pretty slow ?
1.seems ankidroid is processing data during the delay
and it has almost equal speed between rust and py impl

integrate ankisyncctl into ankisyncd  ?
1.use U flag to acess ankisyncctl

add embeded cert https based on rustls
1.ok

build for linux x86_64 and aarch64
1.x86_64:sucessfully build using musl-gcc,dynamically linked
openssl made build from c source using musl-gcc
2.try to corss-compile for aarch64,as ring is not able to be 
compiled. use openssl made on raspberry with gnu-gcc,failed
3.try to corss-compile for aarch64,use openssl make on x86_64
,openssl cross-compiled sucessfully ,yet build failed
4.use musl to compile openssl for x86_64,and cross-compile:failed,
adding symbols: file in wrong format
5.use musl-gcc to  corss-compile openssl for aarch64 in another
way,then build :sucessfully build staticly linked binaries
6.use musl-gcc to compile openssl for x86_64, and build:cannot
build staticly linked binary


cross compile for linux armv7
1.openssl and ankisyncd by rpitools arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc,build
flags lgcc/static: sucessfully build,yet crash with bad system call,
for GNU/Linux 2.6.32 in file info 
2.openssl and ankisyncd by arm-linux-musleabihf-gcc: cannot
compile openssl error: '-mfloat-abi=hard': selected processor lacks an FPU
3.openssl by rpitools arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc,ankisyncd by arm-linux-musleabihf-gcc ,
before build ankisyncd ,set env var CC=rpitools arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc
sucessfully compiled and run well on termux(64bits)

user manager addhere to env_variables auth_db path?

replace sync_method with backend(global state).sync_server_method(input) and use  backend.open_collection(input)
1. fail,seems blocked ,may be incompatible with async/await


replace sync_method with backend(global state).sync_server_method(input) and use  backend.col=session.get_col()
1. fail,seems blocked ,may be incompatible with async/await
2.use bd(sync_app argument/backend) and dont create variable backend,can run but with bugs

delete cards/deck cause sync error on ankidroid?
1.cmp UnchunkedChanges from clients(android/pc),seems no problem,sync well

full_upload -> add cards ->sync -> shutdown syncserver and start->sync ,cause check database errir?
1.server db is not updated in normal syncing process (only full sync will do): I have commented
commit_rust_trx() in anki/rslib/sync/server/finish(),so changes cannot be committed to db,just cancel it.

cannot switch users/profile when server is running?
1.before meta,drop col from backend and add new col into backend when username in backend isnt equal to
that in session (in fn add_col)

docker build on raspberry ubuntu 64bit aarch64: always cannot access to github (crates.io),
search for methods:
1.replace offitial source with tuna source,after severy retries,things seem to work.except for 
4 updates still need to access github.
